<h3> problem_sets</h3>

<h4>in build/classess/problem_set.java all methods required to solve :</h4>
<ul>
<li>Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A
palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be
limited to just dictionary words.
</li>
<li> Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0</li>
<li>A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or
3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child
can run up the stairs.</li>
<li>Write a method to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters</li>
<li>In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the
adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the
adjacent integers</li>
</ul>
